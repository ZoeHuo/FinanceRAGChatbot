I was wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about pricing and share? And maybe also reference, how you're looking at elasticity of demand as a response to pricing? I think, Yvonne, you just said it's definitely a more competitive environment. So, where is Dell going to be kind of flexing more in its ability to drive more share with price, and in what areas do you think that that won't be quite as much, where there might not be as much elasticity of demand? Thank you so much.\")"

The results of operations for the three months ended March 30, 2024 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year ending December 28, 2024 or any other future period. In the opinion of the Company's management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stockholders' equity. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Certain immaterial prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The three months ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 each consisted of 13 weeks. Use of *Estimates.* The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. Significant Accounting *Policies.* There have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\")"
